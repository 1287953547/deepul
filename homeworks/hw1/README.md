# Homework 1: Autoregressive Models

Due February 11, 11:59pm on Gradescope

In this homework, you will implement and train a variety of different autoregressive models, such as MADE and PixelCNN. The homework consists of two components: the IPython notebook and the LaTeX files. Almost all of the assignment is done through the IPython notebook. You can open it in Google Collab to get access to a free GPU, or you can link Collab to a local runtime to run it on your own GPU.  After completing each question in the notebook, images will automatically be saved in a
`results/` folder which you can then  use to replace the placeholder images in `figures/` in the given LaTeX template files. Don't forget to also fill out the default text in the LaTeX file.

On Gradescope, submit the generated PDF from the LaTeX as well as the completed ipynb.
